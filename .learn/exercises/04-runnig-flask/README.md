# `04` Demo your API!!

Go ahead and check your API endpoint by typing this URL on your browser and you should see the `Hello!` message like this:

![Demo your API](../../assets/check-live.gif?raw=true)

Congratulations! Your first endpoint is now LIVE!

## Your URL will be one of two options:

If running through Gitpod, just add `/todos` to the end of your URL in the browser:

```txt
GET https://yourgitpodurl:3245/todos
```

If running locally:

```txt
GET https://localhost:3245/todos
```
